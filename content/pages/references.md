The class studied the following precedents as a precursor to their work and as part of the creation of a collective culture in the studio. These precedents came directly from the work of the installations and from the experiences of the students. These works were discussed in class, fostering a discussion on the issues of student culture, the process of the conscious versus the unconscious, and the relationship of being in space and material. Some were discussed by the whole class, while others related to only one student's work. This relevance was calibrated based on the specific properties and qualities of each student's design, both in spatial and material terms.
