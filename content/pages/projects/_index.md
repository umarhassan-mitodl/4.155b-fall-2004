The work of the students from throughout the semester is presented here, along with brief statements on their work. Each student was allowed to find their own site and define their program, but all worked together on the larger issues of the studio, described in the {{% resource_link 57b7ab02-db91-26d6-6d5c-cc049ea154f7 "assignments" %}} section. These images show their progress, and the steps they took to achieve the goal of creating an architectural project, all the while contributing to the larger debate of the studio through their work.Â All work is courtesy of the student named, and used with permission.
