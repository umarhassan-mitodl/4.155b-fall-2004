"The cultural identity of MIT exists within its intricate network of corridors which extend 'infinitely' above and below ground throughout the campus. The proposed Student Center would introduce a spatial interruption along this corridor system. The design process began with a spatial exploration of the 'corridor', investigating the qualities that exist within it. Qualities of tension, compression and gravitation exist alongside the experiential movement found within the space of the corridor." ({{% resource_link 27281cf4-f63e-61d4-4e33-2cf28179872c "PDF" %}})
