"To be a student is to be in a state of constant transition, with nearly all evidence of one's presence wiped away at graduation. Against this unforgiving institutional backdrop, the clandestine activities of the students taking place late at night form a history which only appears to those who know where to look. What I hoped to investigate in the project is what the transient and elusive might mean in architectural terms." ({{% resource_link d4377b02-e334-f9a7-acaf-6573394bac3f "PDF" %}})
